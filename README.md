Lamb Dynamic Lights for FORGE

A FORGE port of LambDynamicLights (www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lambdynamiclights).
I liked this implementation better than the other similar mods out there for FORGE. So I made it work
for the Minecraft version that I am currently focused on using, 1.18.2. I did not port the menu support,
I honestly did not want to figure out how to port it over lol, so its simply rolled into the config file.
